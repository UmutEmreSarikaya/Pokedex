# Pokedex

This project uses https://pokeapi.co/ to list pokemons and show some information about them. Retrofit is used in this project. Hilt is used for 
dependency injection. MVVM architecture is used on the project.

This project is for learning the basics for sending a request to an API and show the response on a screen. This project was done during my internship at OBSS Technology.
